# same
This is a program that is similar to the UNIX commands less/more. But instead
of being useful, it slowly prints characters out slowly to the console.

Written in Python 3, it can take a file and print the contents of the file
slowly, character-by-character. Input can be piped to this program or can be
specified as a command line argument

### Usage:
```bash
./same.py [in_file]
```
